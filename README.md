# ATM-GUI
to run main.py dowload all moduls and run the code \
main user password: 1234 \
receiver card number: 6037888888888888 \
after running the code for the fisrt time two file named users_transactions.csv and bank_users will be created in your main.py directory \
note that this file is not created for creating user and managing them, the back-end file is just for making the main.py more realistic, so you should make user by coding the ATM_back_end.py \
for resetting the main user balance you can just delete the bank_users file
